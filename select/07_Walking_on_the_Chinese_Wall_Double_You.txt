Walking on a Chinese
Walking on a Chinese wall
Walking on a Chinese
Walking on a Chinese wall
Walking on a Chinese
Walking on a Chinese wall

Butterfly spread your painted wings
For an answer from the Ching
By the stream stretching in the rocks
Tigers on the mountain top

Walking on the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the East
Looking for my olden fleece
Ivory skin scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak

Three misty nights waiting by the shore
Maybe that my lover comes no more
Red chamber dream from the sky above
Ancient tale of hidden Chinese love

On the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Blue red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Steeping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me

Come down the clouds to the sea of flames
From the mountain hear the cry of pain
Red chamber dream from the sky above
Ancient tale of hidden Chinese love

On the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to fall
Walking on the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to fall
