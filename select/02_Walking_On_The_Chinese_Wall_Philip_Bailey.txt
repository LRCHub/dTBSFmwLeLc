Walking on the Chinese
Walking on the Chinese Wall

Watching for the coins to
Watching for the coins to fall

Butterfly, spread your painted wings
For an answer from the Ching
By the stream, stretching in the rocks
Tiger on the mountaintop

Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the East
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin, scarlet colour deep
Lips that burn but do not speak

(Three misty nights waiting by the shore)
It may be that my lover comes no more
(Red chamber dream from the sky above)
Ancient tales of hidden Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Blue-red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me

(Come down the clouds to the sea of flames)
From the mountain hear the cry of pain
(Red chamber dream from the sky above)
Ancient tales of hidden Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall
On the Chinese Wall, oh yeah
Watching for the coins to fall

(On the Chinese Wall)
Butterfly, spread your wings
For an answer from the Ching
(Watching for the coins to fall)
Blue-red silk on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Oh, no

Walking on the Chinese Wall
(Walking on the Chinese, walking on the Chinese wall)
Watching for the coins to fall
(Watching for the coins to, watching for the coins to fall)
